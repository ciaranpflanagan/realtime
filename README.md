# realtime
A quick site built to give you the next bus time and other information. I build it because the Dublin Bus site isn't great especially when using it on mobile.

It's currently live at (http://transport.cicisoft.net), go check it out.

The site uses the Real-time Passenger Information (RTPI) API. The documentation for which can be found at (https://data.gov.ie/dataset/real-time-passenger-information-rtpi-for-dublin-bus-bus-eireann-luas-and-irish-rail)
